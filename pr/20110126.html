		<p><em>GEO, Global Exercise Operation</em> is a game that integrates physical activity with traditional role-playing game elements utilizing the power and portability of the iPhone.

It allows players to track their actual health while they improve their character&rsquo;s health and abilities in the game. <em>GEO</em> includes a fast paced soundtrack to keep the player pumped up during workout/gameplay, or they can use their own workout mix with iPod integration. <em>GEO</em> also takes advantage of the stunning iPhone 4 Retina Display with amazing high resolution graphics.</p>
